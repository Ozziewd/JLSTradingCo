        About Us
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Since 2012, JLS Trading Company has been in the business of taking great products and
      selling them with passion.
      We operate private label brands in nearly every consumer category from toys to tools
      to office products to gourmet food.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sell millions of dollars per year online and are growing just about 100% per year
      with no end in sight.
      We add dozens of new products every month and are aiming to be a 9-figure company in
      the not too distant future.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Work for Us (Even from Home)
    </h4>
    <p>
      check out our
      <a class="nav-link-career" href="www.jlstradingco.com/careers">careers</a>
      page! it's probably worth checking out and has a lot of useful information (unlike
      normal corporate websites ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting and
      corporate BS? Sadly, we are probably not the
      place for you. If however, you want to work with really nice and competent people in
      a relaxed environment with flexible hours,
      then you might love it here. We have super low turnover because we take care of our
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our basic personnel strategy is to hire smart people regardless of their credentials
      & experience, give them the tools and
      training they need to be successful, and then get out of their way. It’s a lot of fun.
      If you think you’d be a fit, shoot
      us an email, and we’ll see what happens!
    </p>
    <h4>
      Sell to Us
    </h4>
    <p>
      We are very experienced with both wholesale buying and marketing new products. If you
      think your product isn’t being marketed
      to its potential online, then we can probably help. We are happy to put together large
      orders to make working with us worth
      your while; we’re not low-budget tire kickers, despite our founder being a cheap
      bastard – don’t tell him I said that!
    </p>
    <p>
      We are good, easy people to deal with, and we pay our bills on-time (credit references
      available upon request).
    </p>
    <h4>
      Why Is Our Website Simple?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating
      information. One-page (or
      two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal
      of communicating the information we want to communicate.

      Further, we don’t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that
      prioritizes aesthetics over functionality.
      We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive)
      office space/corporate website/indoor
      plumbing to be happy, we probably aren’t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR
      made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She’s no fun.
