    <h4>
      Why Should I Work for JLS Trading Co.?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The short version is that you will be working a company that legitimately cares
      about your happiness, you’ll be able to learn and grow rapidly, you’ll get high
      levels of flexibility that are basically unparalleled, and you’ll get to
      participate in building a company that intends to make the world a better place.
    </p>

    What’s JLS Like?
    You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be
    yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it. You don’t
    have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you’re not – you
    can just be you.

    Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We
    plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we
    identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get
    done. If you’re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more
    responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We’re trying to get huge, and if you
    want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you’re
    gonna like it here.

    Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is
    wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In
    fact, it’s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within two weeks of getting
    hired (seriously).

    Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re
    gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which
    means that you need to rest.

    Full Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again.
    Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing
    pants. Note: This doesn’t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could
    figure out a way to make it work.

    No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are
    pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated,
    we probably aren’t the place for you.

    Flexible Work Hours. This doesn’t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their
    nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don’t care if you work 10 hour days
    4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get
    your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your
    day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late,
    but I’m skeptical)? This is the place for you.

    Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down
    deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.
    Everyone works hard, but is 100% happy to help you if you’re running into trouble.

    No Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can’t say that
    anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.

    No Assholes Allowed. We try very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in,
    but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact
    with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.

    Regular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One
    with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don’t bullshit, so when
    you’re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to get better. And when you’re
    doing well, we do our best to tell you, so you aren’t living in constant anxiety.

    We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly.
    You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest
    time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just
    generally try to make your life easier.

    What Is JLS’s Mission?
    In short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).

    We’ll know we’re successful at achieving this goal when:

    1. We have the right people on the bus and they’re in the right seats.

    2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.

    3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn’t dream of working anywhere else.

    4. Our customers love us.

    5. We’re having a ton of fun.

    6. We’re making a ton of money.

    All of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success.
    This business doesn’t exist to make the founder rich, though that will
    hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of
    these things and won’t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.

    Can I See Some Interviews with Current Employees?
    For sure. See Cynthia – Copywriting Manager, and Kyron – JFN Shipper
    and Processor.

    What Are Your Values?
    We’ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly,
    so if you don’t 100% agree with these, then we aren’t the place for you.
    Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:
